The Smart Attendance System aims to automate the traditional method of taking attendance in classrooms or workplaces using facial recognition technology. Instead of roll calls or manual sign-ins, students or employees will just look at a camera, and the system will automatically record their presence with date and time.

It uses a webcam or CCTV feed and integrates OpenCV (for image processing) and face recognition libraries (like FaceNet or Dlib). The system stores face data securely and maintains a daily attendance report in a database (e.g., SQLite or Firebase). The project can also be expanded with features like real-time notifications, absentee alerts, and a web dashboard for admin/staff.
